# Tic-Tac-Toe-Python

This project is a basic python project I have completed for practise in my python skills.

## Task

Make tic tac toe in python without using any modules.

## Installation

This works for Mac, Linux and Windows and anybody can run it, nothing extra is necessary for installation. However, there are two ways to run this program. You can choose to use python to run it in the command line or you can run the .exe file, which is slower than using python to load up but performance within program is not noticeable.

### METHOD 1: Using Python in the Command Line

This method is requires that python 3 is installed on your system. This method is a little longer to run the program but significantly faster than the other method.

**1.** Make sure that python is installed on your operating system and your python directory is in your PATH

**2.** Download this repository onto your system

**3.** Open the command line and change its directory into the, "Tic Tac Toe (Files)" folder within this repository

**4.** Type "python3 Main_Script.py"

You have successfully run the Python files on your system to play Tic Tac Toe!

### METHOD 2: Running the Executable

This method does not require you have anything pre-installed on your system. It is significantly slower than the other method in terms of start up time, which requires that you wait a few seconds for it to run, but performance within the program is almost identical to METHOD 1.

**1.** Download this repository onto your system

**2.** Open your file explorer, locate it and open the, "Tic Tac Toe (Executable)" folder within the repository

**3.** Right-click the .exe file and click run

You have successfully run the Executable on your system to play Tic Tac Toe!

## Using Tic Tac Toe

Once you have installed and run the program you can start playing the game and testing it.
